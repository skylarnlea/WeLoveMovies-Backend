# WeLoveMovies Backend & API
The backend and API of WeLoveMovies facilitates storage and delivery of WeLoveMovies' movies, theaters, and reviews data. 

Completion of this Thinkful assignment required:
- Installation and use of common middleware packages
- Use of routes to receive requests
- Access to relevant information through route and query parameters
- Creation of error handlers
- An API that follows RESTful design principles
- Creation and customization of a knexfile.js
- Use of Knex to connect to my PostgreSQL database
- Database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
- Return of joined and nested data with Knex
- Routes that respond with the appropriate status code and include a data key in the response
- Creation of database migrations using Knex's migration tool
- Deployment of my backend server to a cloud service (Heroku)
- Use of the CORS package so that requests from the frontend can correctly reach the backend
